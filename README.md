# Welcome to my very first REST API using Go programming language
This is my first time getting my hands on Go programming language after doing website and api with javascript.

## Technologies I used
I intend to create a REST API without relying as much as possible with frameworks and packages
- Gorilla/Mux
- Docker
- PostgreSQL

## Endpoints /api/v1
As of now it is pretty simple but I will try to expand it more while learning the language deeply
- Accounts
    - POST /accounts
    - GET /accounts/:id
    - GET /accounts
    - DELETE /accounts/:id

- Transfers
    - POST /transfer
    - GET /transfers
    - GET /transfers-from/:id
    - GET /transfers-to/:id

## WIP
As of now this are what I'm still working on
- Transfer endpoints
- Update account

# SOON
- Authentication
- Thinking about creating FrontEnd
